1) EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
ERPv3 is a Next.js 14 (App Router) TypeScript ERP focused on online‑only operations across Inventory, Sales, Purchasing, Finance, Analytics, and CRM. It uses Prisma + Neon Postgres. RBAC is enforced server‑side; observability with Sentry; security and rate limits via middleware and api() helper. Money is stored in cents; pricing precedence and inventory allocation are strict; COGS is snapshot at allocation; payments follow FIFO. The project is feature‑rich and close to feature complete; a tracked Master To‑Do remains for polish, QA, and some integrations.


2) ENVIRONMENT & SETUP
- Node: >= 18
- Database: Neon Postgres (env DATABASE_URL)
- Install: npm run setup
- Dev: npm run dev
- Build: npm run build; Start: npm start
- Prisma: npm run db:generate; npm run db:push; npm run db:seed
- Tests: npm run test (unit + e2e); typecheck: npm run typecheck
- Sentry: SENTRY_DSN (+ SENTRY_TRACES_SAMPLE_RATE, SENTRY_DEBUG)
- RBAC: ENABLE_RBAC=true, optional RBAC_DEFAULT_ROLE
- Rate Limiting: RATE_LIMIT_TOKENS / RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS
- Uploads: UPLOAD_DIR (local; see Integrations for object storage migration)


3) REPOSITORY STRUCTURE & KEY PATHS
- src/app: Next.js App Router pages
- src/app/api: Route handlers (all business endpoints)
- src/actions: Server actions per module (inventory, finance, quotes, etc.)
- src/components: UI primitives + feature components (analytics, client, inventory)
- src/lib: Core libs (auth, api, pricing, cogs, observability, pdf, schemas, etc.)
- prisma/schema.prisma: DB schema (single source of truth)
- docs/*: Product & technical documentation
- tests, e2e: Jest + Playwright
- middleware.ts: RBAC header defaults + rate limiting
- new utility: src/lib/sequences.ts (nextInvoiceNumber)

Notable feature pages:
- Inventory: src/app/inventory/**/*
- Finance: src/app/finance/**/* (AR, AP, Payments, Credits, Vendor Settlements, Rebates)
- Sales: src/app/quotes/*, src/app/orders/*, src/app/b2b/orders/*
- Analytics: src/app/analytics/**/*
- Clients: src/app/clients/**/*


4) TECH STACK & CONVENTIONS
- Next.js 14 App Router; React 18; TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Prisma ORM; Postgres
- Zod for validation; api() helper for route contracts (roles, rate, parse, schemas)
- Money in cents (integers); display formatted dollars
- Server‑side RBAC checks; never trust client
- Prefer server actions for UI mutations; use revalidatePath where needed
- Allocation and COGS on allocationDate; FIFO for payments and inventory allocation


5) AUTHENTICATION, RBAC, POSTING LOCK, RATE LIMITS
- Auth: Stack Auth SDK integrated (src/stack.ts; app/layout wrapped with StackProvider/StackTheme); wire users↔roles in DB (pending final mapping); middleware sets x-user-role from RBAC_DEFAULT_ROLE if ENABLE_RBAC=true and header unset.
- RBAC: src/lib/auth.ts requireRole used throughout actions and api.
- Posting lock: src/lib/system.ensurePostingUnlocked prevents writes if locked via SystemStatus singleton.
- Rate limits: middleware + api helper.


6) DATA MODEL & BUSINESS RULES (KEY RULES)
- Money stored as integer cents; never float in persistence.
- Vendor masking: display vendorCode everywhere; show companyName only within vendor profile views.
- Pricing precedence: Customer PriceBook > Role PriceBook > Global PriceBook > Product default.
- Allocation: allocate FIFO from InventoryLot by Batch createdAt; lock rows FOR UPDATE; decrement available/increment allocated.
- COGS: snapshot using BatchCost effective at allocationDate on each OrderItem; immutable afterward.
- AR: invoiceNumber unique; aging buckets 0‑30/31‑60/61‑90/90+; dunning preview + logging.
- Payments: created with method + reference; applications recorded to AR via PaymentApplication; FIFO application oldest AR first; create CustomerCredit for overpay.
- AP: vendor invoices tracked with aging and exports; simple apply payment decrementing balance.


7) MODULE‑BY‑MODULE OVERVIEW
Inventory
- Batches/Lots: intake, cost history, availability; exports; cycle count plans and task submit/apply; discrepancies resolve with confirmations + undo; returns (customer/vendor); transfers; adjustments; low stock alerts + nightly preview/apply.
- Allocator: src/lib/inventoryAllocator.ts (allocateFIFO, allocateFIFOByProduct alias, allocateFromSpecificLot, shipAllocated).

Sales
- Quotes: build, price evaluation (getEffectiveUnitPrice), reprice, status transitions, PDF, tokenized share; convert to orders with allocation and consignment AP accrual; credit limit enforcement with override audit logging option in API route.
- Orders: list and detail; Ship action reduces onHand and allocated; packing slip PDF.

Purchasing
- Purchase Orders: create/list/detail; PDF; status lifecycle.

Finance
- AR: list, aging, export; dunning preview + Sentry log; bad debt route.
- Payments: record payment; apply to invoices per‑invoice; FIFO button to auto‑apply open balances for an existing payment; remaining overpay becomes CustomerCredit; list of payments.
- AP: list, sort/filter, export/aging; apply payments.
- Credits: list/apply; Credit Memos tracked.
- Vendor settlements & rebates: create/list; export.

Clients/CRM
- Client profile with panels: summary, smart alerts, unified ledger, credit & terms, consignments, orders & quotes, AP & AR, notes & reminders, documents.

Analytics
- Reports: spec + presentation; builder; evaluate; export; snapshots; duplicate.
- Dashboards: create/view/edit; add/remove/reorder/resize; widget title rename; metadata edit; per‑widget viz override; grid implementation in DashboardGrid; ReportRenderer supports kpi/bar/line/pie/table.

Alerts & QA
- Alerts: rules + nightly evaluation; replenishment preview/apply/nightly.
- QA: profitability nightly; reservations‑expiry; self‑heal tasks writing errors to Sentry and locking posting on unresolved errors.

Documents & Attachments
- Upload/list/archive; file handling with basic constraints.

Samples
- Transactions (vendor_in, client_out, client_return, vendor_return) move inventory without revenue.

Search
- Search interface + filters.

Admin
- Audit Log; QA console; import tooling.


8) API ENDPOINTS INVENTORY (FULL LIST)
The following routes exist under src/app/api (Globbing route.ts):
- audit/route.ts
- categories/route.ts; categories/[id]/route.ts

9) CORE FLOWS (END‑TO‑END)
- Search → Cart → Quote → Share → Accept → Convert to Order → Allocate (FIFO) → COGS Snapshot → AR invoice created → AP consignment accruals as needed → Ship → Packing Slip PDF → Payment recorded → Apply to AR (per‑invoice or FIFO) → Remaining credit becomes CustomerCredit.
- Inventory intake + BatchCost → Lots on hand → Cycle count plan → Task submit/apply → Discrepancy confirmation + undo → Inventory transfers/adjustments/returns → Low stock alerts and replenishment preview/apply.
- Purchasing: PO create → PDF → Receive (future step if not fully wired) → Cost updates.
- Pricing: PriceBooks (global/role/customer) read during quote/order; fallbacks to product default; discounts and repricing flow for quotes.
- Finance AR: Aging buckets + Dunning preview/logging; Bad debt; Exports.
- Finance AP: Vendor invoices tracking with export/aging; simple payment application.
- Analytics: Reports builder → Evaluate → Save → Dashboard widgets (add/reorder/resize/remove/rename) → Viz override → Snapshots; Drilldown and export where available.
- Attachments: Upload/list/archive with limits; PDFs generated for Quotes/Orders/POs.
- Samples: vendor_in/client_out/client_return/vendor_return with inventory impact and no revenue.


10) CURRENT STATUS – MASTER TO‑DO
Completed (highlights)
- Home dashboard redesign + KPIs + activity
- Inventory discrepancies resolution flow (confirmations + undo)
- Quotes→Orders conversion with allocation + COGS; packing slip; shipping endpoint
- Finance AR aging + Dunning preview/log; AP/AR/Payments UIs; exports
- Analytics dashboards + widgets + viz override; ReportRenderer; builder
- Stack Auth integration in layout; RBAC middleware; Sentry instrumentation

In Progress
- Inventory: cycle count workflow polish (task UI, discrepancy apply, summary reports)
- Observability/Security: Sentry performance spans + breadcrumbs; expand Semgrep rules
- Smoke test navigation and home data fetches

Pending
- Inventory workflow polish across adjustments/returns/transfers/rebuild
- Standardize SWR fetcher and error/loading templates
- Consolidate Zod schemas per module; tighten api() schemas
- Remove unused deps: html2canvas, puppeteer (Playwright used)
- Fix duplicate 'use client' directives
- Auth: finalize user↔role mapping in DB; UI guards
- File storage: migrate attachments to object storage with signed URLs
- Testing: add Jest coverage for pricing/discounts, allocator, finance; Playwright E2E for RBAC, rate‑limit, posting‑lock
- Low‑stock replenishment finalization (apply + scheduling)
- Analytics: editor polish, widget library, drilldowns, snapshot scheduling, alerts linkage
- Performance: add indexes, pagination defaults, caching for heavy analytics queries
- Docs/Deploy: runbooks, env matrices, Netlify/Vercel deploy plan
- Typecheck: ensure allocateFIFOByProduct alias in allocator (done); replace direct imports if desired
- Sequences: nextInvoiceNumber exists; consider using for invoice/order numbers in convert routes


11) KNOWN RISKS, SKELETONS, WARNINGS
- Money in cents everywhere: audit any UI that still does float math; ensure rounding only at display.
- Pricing edge cases: verify discount rules and repricing under combined PriceBooks.
- Allocation concurrency: allocator uses FOR UPDATE; verify isolation on high‑contention SKUs.
- Sequences: simple nextInvoiceNumber based on last AR; race window exists under high concurrency → consider dedicated sequences table or DB sequence.
- Attachments storage: local; must migrate to object storage for prod.
- Dunning logging: Sentry capture used; add rate limiting if volume grows.
- RBAC header defaulting: ensure ENABLE_RBAC + RBAC_DEFAULT_ROLE configured in all envs.
- Duplicate 'use client' pragmas in a few files—clean up.
- Unused deps: html2canvas, puppeteer.


12) OBSERVABILITY, SECURITY & QA
- Sentry client/server initialized (instrumentation.ts/.client.ts). Tags set per request via lib/observability.
- Self‑heal task can lock posting and emits Sentry messages for unresolved errors.
- CI: rbac-lint workflow present; Semgrep integration available; expand ruleset.
- Exports must sanitize sensitive fields based on role; confirm across finance/inventory exports.


13) TESTING
- Unit: Jest (npm run test:unit); focus areas: pricing, allocator, finance actions.
- E2E: Playwright (npm run test:e2e); scenarios: core navigation, RBAC gating, payments FIFO, quote→order→ship.
- Typecheck: npm run typecheck (tsc); current fixes include allocator alias and dashboard viz types.


14) DEPLOYMENT & ENVIRONMENTS
- Next.js build/start; Postgres Neon over SSL
- Sentry env vars recommended; traces sample rate tuned per env
- Enable RBAC, rate limits, and posting lock per policy
- Serve behind CDN; configure allowed origins for preview if embedding (allowedDevOrigins)


15) MCP INTEGRATIONS (AVAILABLE + SUGGESTED)
Available in Builder.io MCP: Netlify, Zapier, Figma (Builder plugin), Supabase, Builder CMS, Linear, Notion, Context7, Prisma Postgres, plus already connected Neon, Sentry, Semgrep.
Suggested:
- Connect to Sentry (already connected) for releases and performance dashboards.
- Connect to Netlify for deploy previews and CDN.
- Connect to Prisma Postgres for schema ops; Neon for database management.
- Connect to Builder CMS for marketing content management.
- Connect to Linear/Notion for backlog + documentation sync.


16) RUNBOOKS & DEV TIPS
- Always validate inputs via api() + Zod; set roles on routes; respect posting lock.
- Keep all monetary math in integers; convert to dollars only for display.
- Use server actions with revalidatePath after mutations.
- When adding dashboards/widgets, keep WidgetPosition with vizOverride; ReportRenderer handles viz.
- For invoice/order numbering, switch to sequences helper or DB sequence to avoid collisions.
- For high‑throughput applyPayment FIFO, prefer single transaction and minimal selects.

## Next (Priority)
1. CSV Importer (products/customers/price books) with dry-run + apply.
2. Reservations expiry job + UI countdown.
3. DiscountRule model and combinability rules.
4. RBAC linter in CI and observability standardization.
5. Partial fulfillment & change-order deltas.
6. Ranking/Scoring job + suggestions and outreach reminders.
7. Cycle count plans (ABC) & discrepancy bulk apply.
8. Admin retention settings + purge job.

## Notes
- All new routes must declare roles and follow Zod validation.
- Monetary values in cents; avoid floating point in persistence.
- Exports must sanitize sensitive fields by role.
