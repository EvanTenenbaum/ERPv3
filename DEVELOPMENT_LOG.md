# Development Log

Session: M0 — Repo & Deployment Audit (Initial)

What was accomplished
- Created branch `chore/audit-setup` for M0 work.
- Assessed repo status and pulled latest `main` (fast-forwarded by 3 commits).
- Verified presence of CI workflows for previews and redeploy/probe; confirmed minimal `vercel.json` exists.

Current working state
- Local build not executed in this environment (npm unavailable). Build and preview will be validated via CI/Vercel.
- App structure present with routes: Home, Inventory, Quotes, Search; actions and Prisma setup exist.

Immediate next tasks
- Update README with precise environment setup and validation commands.
- Ensure CI covers lint/typecheck/test/build in PRs.
- Add milestone and issues on GitHub (M0–M5 plan) and link from README.

Update 2
- Added README validation commands and live check steps
- Added `docs/roadmap-issues.md` with milestone and 6 issues (acceptance criteria)
- Added CI workflow `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (lint, typecheck, unit tests, build)
- Pushed branch `chore/audit-setup` to origin; open PR to trigger CI on PR and vercel preview

Next actions (M0)
- Open PR from `chore/audit-setup` to `main` and ensure CI passes
- Create milestone `v0 Beta (M0–M5)` and 6 issues from `docs/roadmap-issues.md`
- Verify preview build (PR) and, if configured, Vercel deployment health at `/api/health`

Blocking issues/dependencies
- Network-restricted environment prevents running `npm ci`/`npm run build` locally here.
- GitHub issue/milestone creation requires API access or manual action.

Verification commands (run locally or in CI)
```bash
npm ci
npm run build
npm run dev
npm test
```

Suggested live checks
- Visit `/` renders home
- `/inventory` renders section dashboard
- `/quotes`, `/quotes/new`, `/search` render without error
- `/api/health` returns 200 JSON
